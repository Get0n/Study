Typing "cat", followed by the filename (like test.py) in the command line will display the code
ex: 
cat test.py

"diff", followed by the filename (like test.py) and another filename will display both files and the differences.
ex:
diff paper1.py paper2.py

  "diff -u" shows a more detailed format to display differences
ex:
diff -u paper1.py paper2.py

"patch" will apply the changes made from a .diff file to the original file

  to apply changes to a file use this:
patch paper1.py paper.diff
  You may need to convert the diff file if they have mismatched line endings. the following code convert to Unicode Format
$ dos2unix paper.diff
